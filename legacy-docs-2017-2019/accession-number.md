# Accession Number

An accession number is a unique identifier assigned to a group of materials received together from the same source.

## Formatting
*   Year_Sequential Number_er (e.g., 2013_49_er)

*   Use the same accession number as the related materials it was received with, if any. If the accession is entirely digital, get the next available accession number from Archivists' Toolkit.

* Include an _er at the end when referring to just the digital component of an accession.
    *   For example, 2013_49_er is used to refer to the digital portion of hybrid accession 2013_49

## Uses of the accession number:

*   Files are organized in temporary preservation storage (e.g., SAN, Linux RAID, or LTO tape) by accession.

*   Documentation about the transfer of the files and actions taken on files during accessioning are organized by accession.

*   Include the accession number in any documentation about the accession.
