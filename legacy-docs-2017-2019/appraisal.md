# Appraisal of Accessions

## Preliminary Appraisal (Before Digital Media Identifier has been assigned)
The first round of preliminary appraisal takes place at the very beginning of accessioning with identified groups of removable media or digital transfers. Media found during processing that does not have related papers can be appraised using these instructions as well. A second round of preliminary appraisal may be done if additional media are found during processing that have related papers, which is a different process because that media will already have a [digital media identifier](./digital-media-identifier.md) and a [removal sheet](./removal-sheets.md).

Use media labels and information from the donor to make a first appraisal decision. This typically only applies to removable media with legible and meaningful labels, where a determination can be made without connecting the storage device to a computer. Unlabeled media, hard drives, and digital transfers rarely have sufficient information for this kind of appraisal unless the donor provides information about their contents.

If an appraisal decision cannot be made without connecting the media to a computer and examining the folders or files directly, which puts them at risk, [appraise later in the workflow](#bookmark=id.f4moq3oqwd3c) once they are copied safely.


There are two possible outcomes from preliminary appraisal:

### 1. **Don't keep any files from a disk or digital transfer**
   * Record a brief summary of what is not being kept in the accession record. This information goes in the "Disposition Note" field in [Archivists' Toolkit](./accession-record_archivists-toolkit.md). The note could include a general description of the content, dates of the materials, a count of the media of each type or other extent information, and the reason(s) they are not being kept.

     Examples:
     * Computer software and published materials (2 linear feet of mixed media)

     *  Medical records, circa 1980-2000 (approximately 100 CDs). Protected by HIPAA and minimal research value.

     * Speech drafts (1 hard drive). Donor indicated these duplicate the papers.

   * If we have legal rights to the collection, dispose of the media in the manner indicated in the deed of gift. Typically it will be securely destroyed. Occasionally disks need to be returned to the donor.

   * If we do not have legal rights, retain the media until we do have the right to dispose of them. Store separately from media where we are retaining files and mark clearly as awaiting destruction after receive a deed of gift.

### 2. **May keep files from a disk or digital transfer**
   * Retaining files at this stage does not guarantee that they will be kept after additional appraisal during accessioning or processing. It simply means that more information is required about the content of the disk or digital transfer to make a determination.

   * No further action, and no documentation, are needed regarding preliminary appraisal.

## Additional Appraisal (After Digital Media Identifier has been assigned)

These should be high level decisions, such as separating entire first-level subfolders or disks. More detailed appraisal, including sampling and de-duplication, should wait until processing. This makes the process more efficient and reduces the risk of altering files.

This step only applies if we have the legal right from the deed of gift to dispose of files, either by deleting them or returning them to the donor.

Review directory information and if necessary preview the files on the original media (using write-blocking technology) within a computer's preview pane, QuickViewPlus, or other program to make additional appraisal decisions. Use the original media because now that the files are copied onto the SAN or LTO tape machine (in preparation for writing to tape), it is the copy that is the focus of preservation rather than the original media.

There are three possible outcomes from additional appraisal:

### 1. **Keep everything from a disk or digital transfer.**

  * No further action or documentation needed regarding appraisal.


### 2. **Keep some things from a disk or digital transfer.**
   * Delete anything not keeping from temporary storage (SAN or LTO tape machine). Return a copy of those files to the donor if required by the deed of gift.

   * Record a summary of what is not being kept in the accession record. In [Archivists' Toolkit](./accession-record_archivists-toolkit.md) the information goes in the "Disposition Note" field. The note could include a general description of the content, dates of the materials, extent information (total file size or file count), and the reason(s) they are not being kept.
   
   Example:
   * Vacation photographs, 2001-2012 (35 gigabytes). Personal with minimal research value.


### 3. **Keep nothing from a disk or digital transfer.**
   * Delete everything from temporary storage (SAN or LTO machine). Return the disk or transfer digitally back to the donor if required by the deed of gift.

   * Record a summary of what is not being kept in the accession record. In [Archivists' Toolkit](./accession-record_archivists-toolkit.md) the information goes in the "Disposition Note" field. The note could include a general description of the content, dates of the materials, extent information (total file size or file count), and the reason(s) they are not being kept.
   
   * Dispose of media that not returning to the donor. Record in the [preservation documentation](./preservation-documentation.md).
    
   Example:
   * Mailing lists, 1985-2014 (50 files). Minimal research value and includes SSN.
