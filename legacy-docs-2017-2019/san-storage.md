# Copying Files to the SAN

Hargrett and Russell A&D each have 1 TB of space on the SAN server (G: Drive) to be used as temporary storage in digital accessioning and processing workflows. The SAN is maintained by Library Systems. A limited number of SCL staff have access to their own library's portion of the SAN and Library Systems staff also have access to both spaces. Library Systems backs up the space daily to a server located in another building on campus.

Hargrett and Russell A&D save accessioned files to the SAN when:

*   The accession will be processed soon.

    *   Write to [the LTO tape machine](./lto-tape-machine.md) instead if the accession will not be processed soon. Media and Russell Oral History and Media always write to tape.


*   It is a small accession that will be temporarily stored on the SAN until there are enough accessions to write to LTO tape.

## 1. Make a folder to save the files to
* Make a folder for the collection if one is not already present. Name the folder with the collection number (e.g., RBRL_281_HD).

* Create a folder named with the accession number inside the collection folder (e.g., 2017_01_er)

## 2. Copy the files to the folder
* Copy the files to the accession folder using [TeraCopy](./teracopy.md), which confirms that no files are altered during copying.

* Files from each piece of transfer media should be in their own folder within the accession folder. Name the folder with the [digital media identifier](./digital-media-identifier.md) followed by the media label (e.g., rbrl-281-fd3-001_speeches-2003).

* Files received on [5.25" floppy disks](./5-25-floppy-disk.md) are copied using a computer that has the appropriate drive.

* Record the results of the copying in the [preservation documentation](./preservation-documentation.md).

## 3. Removal Sheets
* Download any [removal sheets](./removal-sheets.md) from Google Drive and save in the accession folder.
