# Removal Sheets

Removal sheets record the relationship between a piece of digital media and related papers that were transferred to the archives together in the same housing, sometimes in the same folder.

Always create a removal sheet if the media and papers are from the same folder. If they are from the same box, evaluate how likely it is that they are directly related based on the subjects of the media title and papers. Do not create a removal sheet if it appears that the media were just put in the box because there was available space.

## 1. Make Removal Sheet

* When a piece of media is located, leave it in place and create a removal sheet using the appropriate template. When multiple pieces of media are found in one location, make one removal sheet for the entire group of media.

* The removal sheet should include the following information:

    * **Title on Media:** transcribe any information written on the media

    * **Series:** name of the archival series the media is associated with, if known (e.g., “audiovisual recordings”)

    * **Type of Media:** media format type (e.g., 3.5" floppy disk)

    * **Collection:** archival collection name and number (e.g., RBRL/444 Tom Crawford Papers)

    * **Accession:** accession number (e.g., 2017_55_er)

    * **Box:** number of box the media was removed from, if known

    * **Folder:** title of folder the media was removed from, if applicable

    * **Digital Media Identifier:** individual [identifier](./digital-media-identifier.md) assigned to media (e.g., rbrl-340-cd-001)

    * **Reason Removed:** will usually be "Transferred to digital archivist for accessioning and preservation."
    * **Date:** date the media was removed (e.g., 2018-04-06)

    * **Removed by:** name of the person who removed the media

* Save a digital copy of the removal sheet as a pdf. Name the file “digital-media-identifier_removal-sheet" (e.g., “rbrl340cd001_removal-sheet”)

## 2. Remove Media from Collection

* Print a copy of the removal sheet and place it in the folder where the media is located.

    * If no files from a piece of media are retained after additional appraisal or processing, the printed removal sheet should be removed from the box.


* Remove the media from the folder.

* Write the Digital Media Identifier on each piece of media.

## 3. Preliminary Appraisal

* If the media was found by students during processing and has not yet been reviewed by an archivist, do [preliminary appraisal](./appraisal.md) before proceeding to the next step. 

* If no files from a piece of media are retained, the printed removal sheet should be removed from the box.
