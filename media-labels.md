# Transcribing Media Labels

Media labels should only be transcribed if they are especially useful or descriptive and are too long to put in the directory name.

* Create a CSV with the following columns: Collection, Accession, DMID, Media_Label, Orig_Location (if applicable, the place the media was pulled from as recorded on the removal sheet)

* Save the file as "(accession-number)_medialabels.csv" in the accession folder

* In the "Media_Label" column, transcribe the text as written using pipes "|" where there are line breaks

* Consider not just written labels but printed information as well, which can include the date, the number of files, etc.
