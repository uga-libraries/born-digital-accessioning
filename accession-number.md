# Accession Number

An accession number is a unique identifier assigned to a group of materials received together from the same source. There can be multiple accession numbers associated with the same source and collection if accessions are received at different times. 

## Formatting
*   Year-SequentialNumber-ER (YYYY-##-ER)

*   This number is assigned by the collection's archivist or processor when the accession is added to the digital archivist's accessioning queue. Digital materials are usually received as components of hybrid collections, so they are identified and grouped into accessions by the processors handling the analog materials. 
    * One library prefers to use the same accession number (YYYY-##) to link an analog accession with its ER counterpart. The other library prefers to assign the number sequentially. Leaving numbering up to the processors in each library allows them to maintain their established system.
    * It also prevents different staff members from accidentally assigning the same accession numbers multiple times.

*   If the digital archivist receives collection material directly from a donor or materials from a collection with no paper component, the accession number should still be assigned by the archivist in the library responsible for the collection.

## Uses of the accession number:

*   It groups materials that are subject to the same donor agreement and were handled by the same library staff.

*   Files are organized by accession from the point of accessioning until they are ingested into the digital preservation system.

*   The number is used to identify all documentation of the accessioning decisions and actions performs on that group of materials.
