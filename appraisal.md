# Preliminary Appraisal

This preliminary appraisal occurs *after* all of the materials in the accession have arrived at the Libraries and *before* the [Digital Media Identifiers](./digital-media-identifier.md) (DMIDs) are assigned. This process gives the digital archivist a sense of all of the media in the accession and is an opportunity to identify material that does not need to be copied. Making these high-level decisions at this point saves storage space and the time that would be invested in unnecessary virus scanning and copying.

## Before assigining Digital Media Identifiers (DMIDs)

* Look through all the media in the accession before connecting them to a computer. Use labels and information from the donor to identify any media that does not need to be copied. This typically includes labeled software installation disks, other commercial products that are clearly outside the scope of the collection, or media that the donor has identified as a duplicate or accidental inclusion.

* Do not assume that unlabeled media are blank unless they are sealed in their original packaging.

* This preliminary appraisal process can continue as the media are first connected to the quarantine computer for [virus scanning](./virus-scanning.md). If media are discovered to be blank, they can be appraised out prior to assigning a DMID.

* Files that are retained during this preliminary appraisal can still be appraised out later on. 

## Documenting preliminary appraisal decisions

* Document all appraisal decisions in the "Disposition Note" field in the [ArchivesSpace accession record](./accession_record_archivesspace.md). Include a brief description of the media and why it was not kept.

   Examples:
   
   * 3 CDs of Adobe installation software.

   * 4 blank 3.5" floppy disks.

   * 1 thumb drive labeled "Posters" that donor says duplicate the paper materials.

   * 2 commercial DVDs of the movie "Kung Fu Panda" that are unrelated to the collection.

## Handling media that has been appraised out

Contact the archivist responsible for the collection to check the terms in the deed of gift.

   * If we have legal rights to the collection, dispose of the media in the manner indicated in the deed of gift. Typically it will be securely destroyed, but there are situations in which the material needs to be offered back to the donor.

   * If we do not have legal rights, the material may be offered back to the donor. Otherwise the library must retain the media until we have the right to securely destroy it. Label the media with its collection and accession number and a note that it is to be destroyed. Store it separately from the rest of the accession until legal rights are obtained.
