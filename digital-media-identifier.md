# Digital Media Identifiers (DMID)

*Copied from the [2019 workflow](https://github.com/uga-libraries/born-digital-accessioning/tree/main/legacy-docs-2017-2019) with minor changes.*

Each piece of transfer media or group of digital files transferred together is assigned a unique identifier. This identifier will be used to document which files were received together and to link accession and preservation documentation to files. This information is most important for transfer media that was utilized during the course of the creator's work, where the choice for what to put on the disk likely reflects a decision about what belongs together.

An identifier should be assigned to any media or digital transfer retained after [preliminary appraisal](./appraisal.md). If media are found during processing that do not have related papers, they should be appraised using that method as well before assigning a DMID. Media with related papers will be assigned a DMID as part of the process of noting their original location before they are appraised and so require a different preliminary appraisal procedure.


## Creating Identifiers

Each identifier consists of four components:

1. **Repository code:** rbrl, harg-ms, or harg-ua

2. **Collection number:**  For collections that also have a letter code, do not include the letters.

3. **Transfer media code:** The purpose of this code is to make it easier to manage statistics about the types of storage media we receive (see table below).

4. **Sequential number**:  Three digits, with two leading zeroes (e.g. 001, 002), for each type of media. Continue the numbering sequence from previous accessions.



### Transfer Media Codes

Code | Type of Transfer Media | Notes
---- | ---------------------- | -----
CC | Digital Camera Card| e.g., SD card, micro SD card 
CD | Compact Disc| If the disk or disk label does not indicate whether it is a CD or DVD, the default is CD.
DVD | DVD optical disk | If the disk or disk label does not indicate whether it is a CD or DVD, the default is CD.
F | Folder | For digital transfers, such as by email or file sharing application.
FD3 | 3.5" floppy disk |
FD5 | 5.25" floppy disk |
G | G: Drive (SAN) | Legacy designation for files that were copied to the RussLib collection folder on the G: Drive prior to digital accessioning practices being established.
HD | External hard drive |
IHD | Internal hard drive | For files copied directly from a computer hard drive
SR | Scanned by Russell staff | For instances where the Russell Library makes a scan of the original and then returns the original to the donor.
USB | USB Flash Drive |
Z | Zip disk |


## Use of Identifiers


*   Write the identifier on the transfer media with archival pen.

    *   For CDs and DVDs, write the identifier on the inner circle of the disk.

    *   For other media, write the identifier on the label.

    *   If there is no label (like on a thumb drive), create one.

*   Include at the beginning of the folder title for the files copied from the media.

*   Include in all documentation referring to the accession, including the accession record and [preservation log](./preservation-documentation.md). Ultimately, it should be possible to determine how each group of files with a DMID was handled during processing (i.e. which AIPs include files from a particular accession and if any files were separated).
